 nonce and writes the result to |out|, which may be equal to |inp|.

 said material collected into 8 32-bit elements array in host byte
 order. Same approach applies to nonce: the |counter| argument is
 pointer to concatenated nonce and counter values collected into 4
 32-bit elements. This, passing crypto material collected into 32-bit
 elements as opposite to passing verbatim byte vectors, is chosen for
 efficiency in multi-call scenarios.

 This optimization uses ideas from https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/239,
 specifically optimization of cache-timing attack countermeasures,
 pre-computation optimization, and Almost Montgomery Multiplication.

 The paper discusses a 4-bit window to optimize 512-bit modular
 exponentiation, used in RSA-1024 with CRT, but RSA-1024 is no longer
 important.

 |bn_mul_mont_gather5| and |bn_power5| implement the ""almost""
 reduction variant, so the values here may not be fully reduced.
 They are bounded by R (i.e. they fit in |top| words), not |m|.
 Additionally, we pass these ""almost"" reduced inputs into
 |bn_mul_mont|, which implements the normal reduction variant.
 Given those inputs, |bn_mul_mont| may not give reduced
 output, but it will still produce ""almost"" reduced output.

 Triggers a key update. The key update will be started by inverting the Key
 Phase bit of the next packet transmitted; no key update occurs until the next
 packet is transmitted. Thus, this function should generally be called
 immediately before queueing the next packet.

 There are substantial requirements imposed by RFC 9001 on under what
 circumstances a key update can be initiated. The caller is responsible for
 meeting most of these requirements. For example, this function cannot be
 called too soon after a previous key update has occurred. Key updates also
 cannot be initiated until the 1-RTT encryption level is reached.

 As a sanity check, this function will fail and return 0 if the non-1RTT
 encryption levels have not yet been dropped.

 The caller may decide itself to initiate a key update, but it also MUST
 initiate a key update where it detects that the peer has initiated a key
 update. The caller is responsible for initiating a TX key update by calling
 this function in this circumstance; thus, the caller is responsible for
 coupling the RX and TX QUIC record layers in this way.

 The following functions are used to add strings to be printed and prompt
 strings to prompt for data.  The names are UI_{add,dup}_<function>_string
 and UI_{add,dup}_input_boolean.

 UI_{add,dup}_<function>_string have the following meanings:
      add     add a text or prompt string.  The pointers given to these
              functions are used verbatim, no copying is done.
      dup     make a copy of the text or prompt string, then add the copy
              to the collection of strings in the user interface.
      <function>
              The function is a name for the functionality that the given
              string shall be used for.  It can be one of:
                      input   use the string as data prompt.
                      verify  use the string as verification prompt.  This
                              is used to verify a previous input.
                      info    use the string for informational output.
                      error   use the string for error output.
 Honestly, there's currently no difference between info and error for the
 moment.

 UI_{add,dup}_input_boolean have the same semantics for ""add"" and ""dup"",
 and are typically used when one wants to prompt for a yes/no response.

 All of the functions in this group take a UI and a prompt string.
 The string input and verify addition functions also take a flag argument,
 a buffer for the result to end up with, a minimum input size and a maximum
 input size (the result buffer MUST be large enough to be able to contain
 the maximum number of characters).  Additionally, the verify addition
 functions takes another buffer to compare the result against.
 The boolean input functions take an action description string (which should
 be safe to ignore if the expected user action is obvious, for example with
 a dialog box with an OK button and a Cancel button), a string of acceptable
 characters to mean OK and to mean Cancel.  The two last strings are checked
 to make sure they don't have common characters.  Additionally, the same
 flag argument as for the string input is taken, as well as a result buffer.
 The result buffer is required to be at least one byte long.  Depending on
 the answer, the first character from the OK or the Cancel character strings
 will be stored in the first byte of the result buffer.  No NUL will be
 added, so the result is *not* a string.

 On success, the all return an index of the added information.  That index
 is useful when retrieving results with UI_get0_result(). ",6,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,195,22.01.2015,openssl/crypto/ui/ui_lib.c,UI_add_input_string

 Returns the maximum number of packets which the record layer will permit to
 be encrypted using the current set of TX keys. If this limit is reached (that
 is, if the counter returned by ossl_qrx_tx_get_cur_epoch_pkt_count() reaches
 this value), as a safety measure, the QTX will not permit any further packets
 to be queued. All calls to ossl_qrx_write_pkt that try to send packets of a
 kind which need to be encrypted will fail. It is not possible to recover from
 this condition and the QTX must then be destroyed; therefore, callers should
 ensure they always trigger a key update well in advance of reaching this
 limit.

 The value returned by this function is based on the ciphersuite configured
 for the given encryption level. If keys have not been provisioned for the
 specified enc_level or the enc_level argument is invalid, this function
 returns UINT64_MAX, which is not a valid value. Note that it is not possible
 to perform a key update at any encryption level other than 1-RTT, therefore
 if this limit is reached at earlier encryption levels (which should not be
 possible) the connection must be terminated. Since this condition precludes
 the transmission of further packets, the only possible signalling of such an
 error condition to a peer is a Stateless Reset packet.

 Multiply a point by X448_ENCODE_RATIO, then encode it like RFC 7748.

 This function is mainly used internally, but is exported in case
 it will be useful.

 The ratio is necessary because the internal representation doesn't
 track the cofactor information, so on output we must clear the cofactor.
 This would multiply by the cofactor, but in fact internally points are always
 even, so it multiplies by half the cofactor instead.

 As it happens, this aligns with the base point definitions; that is,
 if you pass the Decaf/Ristretto base point to this function, the result
 will be X448_ENCODE_RATIO times the X448
 base point.

 Provides a secret to the QRX, which arises due to an encryption level change.
 enc_level is a QUIC_ENC_LEVEL_* value. To initialise the INITIAL encryption
 level, it is recommended to use ossl_quic_provide_initial_secret instead.

 You should seek to call this function for a given EL before packets of that
 EL arrive and are processed by the QRX. However, if packets have already
 arrived for a given EL, the QRX will defer processing of them and perform
 processing of them when this function is eventually called for the EL in
 question.

 suite_id is a QRL_SUITE_* value which determines the AEAD function used for
 the QRX.

 The secret passed is used directly to derive the ""quic key"", ""quic iv"" and
 ""quic hp"" values.

 secret_len is the length of the secret buffer in bytes. The buffer must be
 sized correctly to the chosen suite, else the function fails.

 This function can only be called once for a given EL, except for the INITIAL
 EL, which can need rekeying when a connection retry occurs. Subsequent calls
 for non-INITIAL ELs fail, as do calls made after a corresponding call to
 ossl_qrx_discard_enc_level for that EL. The secret for a non-INITIAL EL
 cannot be changed after it is set because QUIC has no facility for
 introducing additional key material after an EL is setup. QUIC key updates
 are managed semi-automatically by the QRX but do require some caller handling
 (see below).

 md is for internal use and should be NULL.

 Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.

 Master function used when we want to start tearing down a connection:

   - If the connection is still IDLE we can go straight to TERMINATED;

   - If we are already TERMINATED this is a no-op.

   - If we are TERMINATING - CLOSING and we have now got a CONNECTION_CLOSE
     from the peer (tcause->remote == 1), we move to TERMINATING - DRAINING.

   - If we are TERMINATING - DRAINING, we remain here until the terminating
     timer expires.

   - Otherwise, we are in ACTIVE and move to TERMINATING - CLOSING.
     if we caused the termination (e.g. we have sent a CONNECTION_CLOSE). Note
     that we are considered to have caused a termination if we sent the first
     CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, even if it is caused by a peer protocol
     violation. If the peer sent the first CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, we move to
     TERMINATING - DRAINING.

 We record the termination cause structure passed on the first call only.
 Any successive calls have their termination cause data discarded;
 once we start sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, we don't change the details
 in it.

 This conforms to RFC 9000 s. 10.2.1: Closing Connection State:
      To minimize the state that an endpoint maintains for a closing
      connection, endpoints MAY send the exact same packet in response
      to any received packet.

       packets to allow it to read and process a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.

 Note that we do not conform to these two from the same section:
      An endpoint's selected connection ID and the QUIC version
      are sufficient information to identify packets for a closing
      connection; the endpoint MAY discard all other connection state.

      An endpoint MAY drop packet protection keys when entering the

 Enrol an Initial ODCID sent by the peer. This is the DCID in the first
 Initial packet sent by a client. When we receive a client's first Initial
 packet, we immediately respond with our own SCID (generated using
 ossl_quic_lcidm_generate_initial) to tell the client to switch to using that,
 so ideally the ODCID will only be used for a single packet. However since
 that response might be lost, we also need to accept additional packets using
 the ODCID and need to make sure they get routed to the same connection and
 not interpreted as another new connection attempt. Thus before the CID
 switchover is confirmed, we also have to handle incoming packets addressed to
 the ODCID. This function is used to temporarily enroll the ODCID for a
 connection. Such a LCID is considered to have a sequence number of
 LCIDM_ODCID_SEQ_NUM internally for our purposes.

 Note that this is the *only* circumstance where we recognise an LCID we did
 not generate ourselves, or allow an LCID with a different length to lcid_len.

 SSL_select_next_proto implements the standard protocol selection. It is
 expected that this function is called from the callback set by
 SSL_CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb. The protocol data is assumed to be a
 vector of 8-bit, length prefixed byte strings. The length byte itself is
 not included in the length. A byte string of length 0 is invalid. No byte
 string may be truncated. The current, but experimental algorithm for
 selecting the protocol is: 1) If the server doesn't support NPN then this
 is indicated to the callback. In this case, the client application has to
 abort the connection or have a default application level protocol. 2) If
 the server supports NPN, but advertises an empty list then the client
 selects the first protocol in its list, but indicates via the API that this
 fallback case was enacted. 3) Otherwise, the client finds the first
 protocol in the server's list that it supports and selects this protocol.
 This is because it's assumed that the server has better information about
 which protocol a client should use. 4) If the client doesn't support any
 of the server's advertised protocols, then this is treated the same as

 Decodes a QUIC STREAM frame.

 If nodata is set to 1 then reading the PACKET stops after the frame header
 and f->data is set to NULL. In this case f->len will also be 0 in the event
 that ""has_explicit_len"" is 0.

 If the frame did not contain an offset field, f->offset is set to 0, as the
 absence of an offset field is equivalent to an offset of 0.

 If the frame contained a length field, f->has_explicit_len is set to 1 and
 the length of the data is placed in f->len. This function ensures that the
 length does not exceed the packet buffer, thus it is safe to access f->data.

 If the frame did not contain a length field, this means that the frame runs
 until the end of the packet. This function sets f->has_explicit_len to zero,
 and f->len to the amount of data remaining in the input buffer. Therefore,
 this function should be used with a PACKET representing a single packet (and
 not e.g. multiple packets).

 Note also that this means f->len is always valid after this function returns
 successfully, regardless of the value of f->has_explicit_len.

 f->data points inside the packet buffer inside the PACKET, therefore it is
 safe to access for as long as the packet buffer exists.

 f->is_fin is set according to whether the frame was marked as ending the
 stream.

 Utility which can be used to poll on up to two FDs. This is designed to
 support use of split FDs (e.g. with SSL_set_rfd and SSL_set_wfd where
 different FDs are used for read and write).

 Generally use of poll(2) is preferred where available. Windows, however,
 hasn't traditionally offered poll(2), only select(2). WSAPoll() was
 introduced in Vista but has seemingly been buggy until relatively recent
 versions of Windows 10. Moreover we support XP so this is not a suitable
 target anyway. However, the traditional issues with select(2) turn out not to
 be an issue on Windows; whereas traditional *NIX select(2) uses a bitmap of
 FDs (and thus is limited in the magnitude of the FDs expressible), Windows
 select(2) is very different. In Windows, socket handles are not allocated
 contiguously from zero and thus this bitmap approach was infeasible. Thus in
 adapting the Berkeley sockets API to Windows a different approach was taken
 whereby the fd_set contains a fixed length array of socket handles and an
 integer indicating how many entries are valid; thus Windows select()
 ironically is actually much more like *NIX poll(2) than *NIX select(2). In
 any case, this means that the relevant limit for Windows select() is the
 number of FDs being polled, not the magnitude of those FDs. Since we only
 poll for two FDs here, this limit does not concern us.

 Usage: rfd and wfd may be the same or different. Either or both may also be
 -1. If rfd_want_read is 1, rfd is polled for readability, and if
 wfd_want_write is 1, wfd is polled for writability. Note that since any
 passed FD is always polled for error conditions, setting rfd_want_read=0 and
 wfd_want_write=0 is not the same as passing -1 for both FDs.

 deadline is a timestamp to return at. If it is ossl_time_infinite(), the call
 never times out.

 condition. We don't elaborate our return values here because the way we are
 actually using this doesn't currently care.
