Sometimes a RedisModuleString may have more memory allocated for
it than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed
from network buffers. This function optimizes such strings by reallocating
their memory, which is useful for strings that are not short lived but
retained for an extended duration.

This operation is *not thread safe* and should only be called when
no concurrent access to the string is guaranteed. Using it for an argv
string in a module command before the string is potentially available
to other threads is generally safe.

Currently, Redis may also automatically trim retained strings when a
module command returns. However, doing this explicitly should still be
a preferred option:

1. Future versions of Redis may abandon auto-trimming.
2. Auto-trimming as currently implemented is *not thread safe*.

 putting internal metadata on hugepages).  Therefore, we use the raw

This will immediately end the auth chain as successful and add the OK reply.
(2) Deny Authentication - Return REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED without authenticating or blocking the
client. Optionally, `err` can be set to a custom error message and `err` will be automatically
freed by the server.
This will immediately end the auth chain as unsuccessful and add the ERR reply.
(3) Block a client on authentication - Use the RM_BlockClientOnAuth API and return
REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED. Here, the client will be blocked until the RM_UnblockClient API is used
which will trigger the auth reply callback (provided through the RM_BlockClientOnAuth).
In this reply callback, the Module should authenticate, deny or skip handling authentication.
(4) Skip handling Authentication - Return REDISMODULE_AUTH_NOT_HANDLED without blocking the
client. This will allow the engine to attempt the next module auth callback.
If none of the callbacks authenticate or deny auth, then password based auth is attempted and
will authenticate or add failure logs and reply to the clients accordingly.

 Synchronization around the fast threshold in tsd --
 There are two threads to consider in the synchronization here:
 - The owner of the tsd being updated by a slow path change
 - The remote thread, doing that slow path change.

 As a design constraint, we want to ensure that a slow-path transition cannot
 be ignored for arbitrarily long, and that if the remote thread causes a
 slow-path transition and then communicates with the owner thread that it has
 occurred, then the owner will go down the slow path on the next allocator
 operation (so that we don't want to just wait until the owner hits its slow
 path reset condition on its own).

 Here's our strategy to do that:

 The remote thread will update the slow-path stores to TSD variables, issue a
 SEQ_CST fence, and then update the TSD next_event_fast counter. The owner
 thread will update next_event_fast, issue an SEQ_CST fence, and then check
 its TSD to see if it's on the slow path.

 This is fairly straightforward when 64-bit atomics are supported. Assume that
 the remote fence is sandwiched between two owner fences in the reset pathway.
 The case where there is no preceding or trailing owner fence (i.e. because
 the owner thread is near the beginning or end of its life) can be analyzed
 similarly. The owner store to next_event_fast preceding the earlier owner
 fence will be earlier in coherence order than the remote store to it, so that
 the owner thread will go down the slow path once the store becomes visible to
 it, which is no later than the time of the second fence.

 The case where we don't support 64-bit atomics is trickier, since word
 tearing is possible. We'll repeat the same analysis, and look at the two
 owner fences sandwiching the remote fence. The next_event_fast stores done
 alongside the earlier owner fence cannot overwrite any of the remote stores
 (since they precede the earlier owner fence in sb, which precedes the remote
 fence in sc, which precedes the remote stores in sb). After the second owner
 fence there will be a re-check of the slow-path variables anyways, so the
 ""owner will notice that it's on the slow path eventually"" guarantee is
 satisfied. To make sure that the out-of-band-messaging constraint is as well,
 note that either the message passing is sequenced before the second owner
 fence (in which case the remote stores happen before the second set of owner
 stores, so malloc sees a value of zero for next_event_fast and goes down the
 slow path), or it is not (in which case the owner sees the tsd slow-path
 writes on its previous update). This leaves open the possibility that the
 remote thread will (at some arbitrary point in the future) zero out one half
 of the owner thread's next_event_fast, but that's always safe (it just sends
 it down the slow path earlier).

is returned.

When the client exist and the `ci` pointer is not NULL, but points to
a structure of type RedisModuleClientInfoV1, previously initialized with
the correct REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_INITIALIZER_V1, the structure is populated
with the following fields:

     uint64_t flags;         // REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_*
     uint64_t id;            // Client ID

     uint16_t port;          // TCP port.
     uint16_t db;            // Selected DB.

Note: the client ID is useless in the context of this call, since we
      already know, however the same structure could be used in other
      contexts where we don't know the client ID, yet the same structure
      is returned.

With flags having the following meaning:

    REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_SSL          Client using SSL connection.
    REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_PUBSUB       Client in Pub/Sub mode.
    REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_BLOCKED      Client blocked in command.

    REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_UNIXSOCKET   Client using unix domain socket.
    REDISMODULE_CLIENTINFO_FLAG_MULTI        Client in MULTI state.

However passing NULL is a way to just check if the client exists in case
we are not interested in any additional information.

returned:

479,1451,38A9DAF8C5706B44,RM_SubscribeToKeyspaceEvents,redis/src/module.c,"Subscribe to keyspace notifications. This is a low-level version of the
keyspace-notifications API. A module can register callbacks to be notified
when keyspace events occur.

Notification events are filtered by their type (string events, set events,
etc), and the subscriber callback receives only events that match a specific
mask of event types.

When subscribing to notifications with RedisModule_SubscribeToKeyspaceEvents
the module must provide an event type-mask, denoting the events the subscriber
is interested in. This can be an ORed mask of any of the following flags:

 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_GENERIC: Generic commands like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_STRING: String events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_LIST: List events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_SET: Set events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_HASH: Hash events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_ZSET: Sorted Set events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_EXPIRED: Expiration events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_EVICTED: Eviction events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_STREAM: Stream events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_MODULE: Module types events
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_KEYMISS: Key-miss events
                               Notice, key-miss event is the only type
                               of event that is fired from within a read command.
                               Performing RM_Call with a write command from within
                               this notification is wrong and discourage. It will
                               cause the read command that trigger the event to be
                               replicated to the AOF/Replica.
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_ALL: All events (Excluding REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_KEYMISS)
 - REDISMODULE_NOTIFY_LOADED: A special notification available only for modules,
                              indicates that the key was loaded from persistence.
                              Notice, when this event fires, the given key
                              can not be retained, use RM_CreateStringFromString
                              instead.

We do not distinguish between key events and keyspace events, and it is up
to the module to filter the actions taken based on the key.

The subscriber signature is:

    int (*RedisModuleNotificationFunc) (RedisModuleCtx *ctx, int type,
                                        const char *event,
                                        RedisModuleString *key);

`type` is the event type bit, that must match the mask given at registration
time. The event string is the actual command being executed, and key is the
relevant Redis key.

Notification callback gets executed with a redis context that can not be
used to send anything to the client, and has the db number where the event
occurred as its selected db number.

Notice that it is not necessary to enable notifications in redis.conf for
module notifications to work.

Warning: the notification callbacks are performed in a synchronous manner,
so notification callbacks must to be fast, or they would slow Redis down.
If you need to take long actions, use threads to offload them.

Moreover, the fact that the notification is executed synchronously means
that the notification code will be executed in the middle on Redis logic
(commands logic, eviction, expire). Changing the key space while the logic
runs is dangerous and discouraged. In order to react to key space events with
write actions, please refer to `RM_AddPostNotificationJob`.

480,2136,5339E6E23FD2DB91,RM_RegisterCommandFilter,redis/src/module.c,"Register a new command filter function.

Command filtering makes it possible for modules to extend Redis by plugging
into the execution flow of all commands.

A registered filter gets called before Redis executes *any* command.  This
includes both core Redis commands and commands registered by any module.  The
filter applies in all execution paths including:

1. Invocation by a client.
2. Invocation through `RedisModule_Call()` by any module.
3. Invocation through Lua `redis.call()`.
4. Replication of a command from a master.

The filter executes in a special filter context, which is different and more
limited than a RedisModuleCtx.  Because the filter affects any command, it
must be implemented in a very efficient way to reduce the performance impact
on Redis.  All Redis Module API calls that require a valid context (such as
`RedisModule_Call()`, `RedisModule_OpenKey()`, etc.) are not supported in a
filter context.

The `RedisModuleCommandFilterCtx` can be used to inspect or modify the
executed command and its arguments.  As the filter executes before Redis
begins processing the command, any change will affect the way the command is
processed.  For example, a module can override Redis commands this way:

1. Register a `MODULE.SET` command which implements an extended version of
   the Redis `SET` command.
2. Register a command filter which detects invocation of `SET` on a specific
   pattern of keys.  Once detected, the filter will replace the first
   argument from `SET` to `MODULE.SET`.
3. When filter execution is complete, Redis considers the new command name
   and therefore executes the module's own command.

Note that in the above use case, if `MODULE.SET` itself uses
`RedisModule_Call()` the filter will be applied on that call as well.  If
that is not desired, the `REDISMODULE_CMDFILTER_NOSELF` flag can be set when
registering the filter.

The `REDISMODULE_CMDFILTER_NOSELF` flag prevents execution flows that
originate from the module's own `RM_Call()` from reaching the filter.  This
flag is effective for all execution flows, including nested ones, as long as
the execution begins from the module's command context or a thread-safe
context that is associated with a blocking command.

Detached thread-safe contexts are *not* associated with the module and cannot
be protected by this flag.

If multiple filters are registered (by the same or different modules), they
are executed in the order of registration.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,9,10754,21.03.2019,redis/src/module.c,RM_RegisterCommandFilter

the selected db.

Callback for scan implementation.

    void scan_callback(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString *keyname,
                       RedisModuleKey *key, void *privdata);

- `ctx`: the redis module context provided to for the scan.
- `keyname`: owned by the caller and need to be retained if used after this
  function.
- `key`: holds info on the key and value, it is provided as best effort, in
  some cases it might be NULL, in which case the user should (can) use
  RedisModule_OpenKey() (and CloseKey too).
  when it is provided, it is owned by the caller and will be free when the
  callback returns.
- `privdata`: the user data provided to RedisModule_Scan().

The way it should be used:

     RedisModuleScanCursor *c = RedisModule_ScanCursorCreate();
     while(RedisModule_Scan(ctx, c, callback, privateData));
     RedisModule_ScanCursorDestroy(c);

It is also possible to use this API from another thread while the lock
is acquired during the actual call to RM_Scan:

     RedisModuleScanCursor *c = RedisModule_ScanCursorCreate();
     RedisModule_ThreadSafeContextLock(ctx);
     while(RedisModule_Scan(ctx, c, callback, privateData)){
         RedisModule_ThreadSafeContextUnlock(ctx);
         // do some background job
         RedisModule_ThreadSafeContextLock(ctx);
     }
     RedisModule_ScanCursorDestroy(c);

The function will return 1 if there are more elements to scan and
0 otherwise, possibly setting errno if the call failed.

It is also possible to restart an existing cursor using RM_ScanCursorRestart.

IMPORTANT: This API is very similar to the Redis SCAN command from the
point of view of the guarantees it provides. This means that the API
may report duplicated keys, but guarantees to report at least one time
every key that was there from the start to the end of the scanning process.

NOTE: If you do database changes within the callback, you should be aware
that the internal state of the database may change. For instance it is safe
to delete or modify the current key, but may not be safe to delete any
other key.
Moreover playing with the Redis keyspace while iterating may have the
effect of returning more duplicates. A safe pattern is to store the keys
names you want to modify elsewhere, and perform the actions on the keys
later when the iteration is complete. However this can cost a lot of
memory, so it may make sense to just operate on the current key when
possible during the iteration, given that this is safe. ",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,14,11054,05.02.2024,redis/src/module.c,RM_Scan

another master a configuration epoch that is equal to our configuration
epoch.

BACKGROUND

It is not possible that different slaves get the same config
epoch during a failover election, because the slaves need to get voted
by a majority. However when we perform a manual resharding of the cluster
the node will assign a configuration epoch to itself without to ask
for agreement. Usually resharding happens when the cluster is working well
and is supervised by the sysadmin, however it is possible for a failover
to happen exactly while the node we are resharding a slot to assigns itself
a new configuration epoch, but before it is able to propagate it.

So technically it is possible in this condition that two nodes end with
the same configuration epoch.

Another possibility is that there are bugs in the implementation causing
this to happen.

Moreover when a new cluster is created, all the nodes start with the same
configEpoch. This collision resolution code allows nodes to automatically
end with a different configEpoch at startup automatically.

In all the cases, we want a mechanism that resolves this issue automatically
as a safeguard. The same configuration epoch for masters serving different
set of slots is not harmful, but it is if the nodes end serving the same
slots for some reason (manual errors or software bugs) without a proper
failover procedure.

In general we want a system that eventually always ends with different
masters having different configuration epochs whatever happened, since
nothing is worse than a split-brain condition in a distributed system.

BEHAVIOR

When this function gets called, what happens is that if this node
has the lexicographically smaller Node ID compared to the other node
with the conflicting epoch (the 'sender' node), it will assign itself
the greatest configuration epoch currently detected among nodes plus 1.

This means that even if there are multiple nodes colliding, the node
with the greatest Node ID never moves forward, so eventually all the nodes
end with a different configuration epoch.",1,3,2,0,0,1,0,15,1762,22.11.2023,redis/src/cluster_legacy.c,clusterHandleConfigEpochCollision

calling the function pointer 'cmdfunc' using the RedisModule calling
convention.

The function returns REDISMODULE_ERR in these cases:
- If creation of module command is called outside the RedisModule_OnLoad.
- The specified command is already busy.
- The command name contains some chars that are not allowed.
- A set of invalid flags were passed.

Otherwise REDISMODULE_OK is returned and the new command is registered.

This function must be called during the initialization of the module
inside the RedisModule_OnLoad() function. Calling this function outside
of the initialization function is not defined.

The command function type is the following:

     int MyCommand_RedisCommand(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv, int argc);

And is supposed to always return REDISMODULE_OK.

The set of flags 'strflags' specify the behavior of the command, and should
be passed as a C string composed of space separated words, like for
example ""write deny-oom"". The set of flags are:

* **""write""**:     The command may modify the data set (it may also read
                   from it).
* **""readonly""**:  The command returns data from keys but never writes.
* **""admin""**:     The command is an administrative command (may change
                   replication or perform similar tasks).
* **""deny-oom""**:  The command may use additional memory and should be
                   denied during out of memory conditions.
* **""deny-script""**:   Don't allow this command in Lua scripts.
* **""allow-loading""**: Allow this command while the server is loading data.
                       Only commands not interacting with the data set
                       should be allowed to run in this mode. If not sure
                       don't use this flag.
* **""pubsub""**:    The command publishes things on Pub/Sub channels.
* **""random""**:    The command may have different outputs even starting
                   from the same input arguments and key values.
                   Starting from Redis 7.0 this flag has been deprecated.
                   Declaring a command as ""random"" can be done using
                   command tips, see https://redis.io/topics/command-tips.
* **""allow-stale""**: The command is allowed to run on slaves that don't
                     serve stale data. Don't use if you don't know what
                     this means.
* **""no-monitor""**: Don't propagate the command on monitor. Use this if
                    the command has sensitive data among the arguments.
* **""no-slowlog""**: Don't log this command in the slowlog. Use this if
                    the command has sensitive data among the arguments.
* **""fast""**:      The command time complexity is not greater
                   than O(log(N)) where N is the size of the collection or
                   anything else representing the normal scalability
                   issue with the command.
* **""getkeys-api""**: The command implements the interface to return
                     the arguments that are keys. Used when start/stop/step
                     is not enough because of the command syntax.
* **""no-cluster""**: The command should not register in Redis Cluster
                    since is not designed to work with it because, for
                    example, is unable to report the position of the
                    keys, programmatically creates key names, or any
                    other reason.
* **""no-auth""**:    This command can be run by an un-authenticated client.
                    Normally this is used by a command that is used
                    to authenticate a client.
* **""may-replicate""**: This command may generate replication traffic, even
                       though it's not a write command.
* **""no-mandatory-keys""**: All the keys this command may take are optional
* **""blocking""**: The command has the potential to block the client.
* **""allow-busy""**: Permit the command while the server is blocked either by
                    a script or by a slow module command, see
                    RM_Yield.
* **""getchannels-api""**: The command implements the interface to return
                         the arguments that are channels.

The last three parameters specify which arguments of the new command are
Redis keys. See https://redis.io/commands/command for more information.

* `firstkey`: One-based index of the first argument that's a key.
              Position 0 is always the command name itself.
              0 for commands with no keys.
* `lastkey`:  One-based index of the last argument that's a key.
              Negative numbers refer to counting backwards from the last
              argument (-1 means the last argument provided)
              0 for commands with no keys.
* `keystep`:  Step between first and last key indexes.
              0 for commands with no keys.

This information is used by ACL, Cluster and the `COMMAND` command.

NOTE: The scheme described above serves a limited purpose and can
only be used to find keys that exist at constant indices.

 Output six memory utilization entries for an input pointer, the first one of
 type (void *) and the remaining five of type size_t, describing the following
 (in the same order):

 (a) memory address of the extent a potential reallocation would go into,
 == the five fields below describe about the extent the pointer resides in ==
 (b) number of free regions in the extent,
 (c) number of regions in the extent,
 (d) size of the extent in terms of bytes,
 (e) total number of free regions in the bin the extent belongs to, and
 (f) total number of regions in the bin the extent belongs to.

 Note that ""(e)"" and ""(f)"" are only available when stats are enabled;
 otherwise their values are undefined.

 This API is mainly intended for small class allocations, where extents are
 used as slab.  Note that if the bin the extent belongs to is completely
 full, ""(a)"" will be NULL.

 In case of large class allocations, ""(a)"" will be NULL, and ""(e)"" and ""(f)""
 will be zero (if stats are enabled; otherwise undefined).  The other three
 fields will be properly set though the values are trivial: ""(b)"" will be 0,
 ""(c)"" will be 1, and ""(d)"" will be the usable size.

 The input pointer and size are respectively passed in by newp and newlen,
 and the output fields and size are respectively oldp and *oldlenp.

 It can be beneficial to define the following macros to make it easier to
 access the output:

 #define SLABCUR_READ(out) (*(void **)out)
 #define COUNTS(out) ((size_t *)((void **)out + 1))
 #define NFREE_READ(out) COUNTS(out)[0]
 #define NREGS_READ(out) COUNTS(out)[1]
 #define SIZE_READ(out) COUNTS(out)[2]
 #define BIN_NFREE_READ(out) COUNTS(out)[3]
 #define BIN_NREGS_READ(out) COUNTS(out)[4]

 and then write e.g. NFREE_READ(oldp) to fetch the output.  See the unit test
 test_query in test/unit/extent_util.c for an example.

 For a typical defragmentation workflow making use of this API for
 understanding the fragmentation level, please refer to the comment for
 experimental_utilization_batch_query_ctl.

 It's up to the application how to determine the significance of
 fragmentation relying on the outputs returned.  Possible choices are:

 (a) if extent utilization ratio is below certain threshold,
 (b) if extent memory consumption is above certain threshold,
 (c) if extent utilization ratio is significantly below bin utilization ratio,
 (d) if input pointer deviates a lot from potential reallocation address, or
 (e) some selection/combination of the above.

 The caller needs to make sure that the input/output arguments are valid,
 in particular, that the size of the output is correct, i.e.:

     *oldlenp = sizeof(void *) + sizeof(size_t) * 5

 Otherwise, the function immediately returns EINVAL without touching anything.

 In the rare case where there's no associated extent found for the input
 pointer, the function zeros out all output fields and return.  Please refer
 to the comment for experimental_utilization_batch_query_ctl to understand the
 motivation from C++.

contains all the commands replicated in a given module command
execution. However the commands replicated with RedisModule_Call()
are the first items, the ones replicated with RedisModule_Replicate()
will all follow before the EXEC.

Modules should try to use one interface or the other.

This command follows exactly the same interface of RedisModule_Call(),
so a set of format specifiers must be passed, followed by arguments
matching the provided format specifiers.

Please refer to RedisModule_Call() for more information.

Using the special ""A"" and ""R"" modifiers, the caller can exclude either
the AOF or the replicas from the propagation of the specified command.
Otherwise, by default, the command will be propagated in both channels.

#### Note about calling this function from a thread safe context:

Normally when you call this function from the callback implementing a
module command, or any other callback provided by the Redis Module API,
Redis will accumulate all the calls to this function in the context of
the callback, and will propagate all the commands wrapped in a MULTI/EXEC
transaction. However when calling this function from a threaded safe context
that can live an undefined amount of time, and can be locked/unlocked in
at will, the behavior is different: MULTI/EXEC wrapper is not emitted
and the command specified is inserted in the AOF and replication stream
immediately.

 Does the same thing, but with the interior of the range, for slab
 allocations.

 You might wonder why we don't just have a single emap_register function that
 does both depending on the value of 'slab'.  The answer is twofold:
 - As a practical matter, in places like the extract->split->commit pathway,
   we defer the interior operation until we're sure that the commit won't fail
   (but we have to register the split boundaries there).
 - In general, we're trying to move to a world where the page-specific
   allocator doesn't know as much about how the pages it allocates will be
   used, and passing a 'slab' parameter everywhere makes that more
   complicated.

 Unlike the boundary version, this function can't fail; this is because slabs
 can't get big enough to touch a new page that neither of the boundaries
 touched, so no allocation is necessary to fill the interior once the boundary
 has been touched.

1159,5558,DC9246FCD30D045C,RM_SubscribeToServerEvent,redis/src/module.c,"Register to be notified, via a callback, when the specified server event
happens. The callback is called with the event as argument, and an additional
argument which is a void pointer and should be cased to a specific type
that is event-specific (but many events will just use NULL since they do not
have additional information to pass to the callback).

If the callback is NULL and there was a previous subscription, the module
will be unsubscribed. If there was a previous subscription and the callback
is not null, the old callback will be replaced with the new one.

The callback must be of this type:

    int (*RedisModuleEventCallback)(RedisModuleCtx *ctx,
                                    RedisModuleEvent eid,
                                    uint64_t subevent,
                                    void *data);

The 'ctx' is a normal Redis module context that the callback can use in
order to call other modules APIs. The 'eid' is the event itself, this
is only useful in the case the module subscribed to multiple events: using
the 'id' field of this structure it is possible to check if the event
is one of the events we registered with this callback. The 'subevent' field
depends on the event that fired.

Finally the 'data' pointer may be populated, only for certain events, with
more relevant data.

Here is a list of events you can use as 'eid' and related sub events:

* RedisModuleEvent_ReplicationRoleChanged:

    This event is called when the instance switches from master
    to replica or the other way around, however the event is
    also called when the replica remains a replica but starts to
    replicate with a different master.

    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPLROLECHANGED_NOW_MASTER`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPLROLECHANGED_NOW_REPLICA`

    The 'data' field can be casted by the callback to a
    `RedisModuleReplicationInfo` structure with the following fields:

        int master; // true if master, false if replica
        char *masterhost; // master instance hostname for NOW_REPLICA
        int masterport; // master instance port for NOW_REPLICA
        char *replid1; // Main replication ID
        char *replid2; // Secondary replication ID
        uint64_t repl1_offset; // Main replication offset
        uint64_t repl2_offset; // Offset of replid2 validity

* RedisModuleEvent_Persistence

    This event is called when RDB saving or AOF rewriting starts
    and ends. The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_RDB_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_AOF_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_SYNC_RDB_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_SYNC_AOF_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_ENDED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_PERSISTENCE_FAILED`

    The above events are triggered not just when the user calls the
    relevant commands like BGSAVE, but also when a saving operation
    or AOF rewriting occurs because of internal server triggers.
    The SYNC_RDB_START sub events are happening in the foreground due to
    SAVE command, FLUSHALL, or server shutdown, and the other RDB and
    AOF sub events are executed in a background fork child, so any
    action the module takes can only affect the generated AOF or RDB,
    but will not be reflected in the parent process and affect connected
    clients and commands. Also note that the AOF_START sub event may end
    up saving RDB content in case of an AOF with rdb-preamble.

* RedisModuleEvent_FlushDB

    The FLUSHALL, FLUSHDB or an internal flush (for instance
    because of replication, after the replica synchronization)
    happened. The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_FLUSHDB_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_FLUSHDB_END`

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleFlushInfo
    structure with the following fields:

        int32_t async;  // True if the flush is done in a thread.
                        // See for instance FLUSHALL ASYNC.
                        // In this case the END callback is invoked
                        // immediately after the database is put
                        // in the free list of the thread.
        int32_t dbnum;  // Flushed database number, -1 for all the DBs
                        // in the case of the FLUSHALL operation.

    The start event is called *before* the operation is initiated, thus
    allowing the callback to call DBSIZE or other operation on the
    yet-to-free keyspace.

* RedisModuleEvent_Loading

    Called on loading operations: at startup when the server is
    started, but also after a first synchronization when the
    replica is loading the RDB file from the master.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_RDB_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_AOF_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_REPL_START`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_ENDED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_FAILED`

    Note that AOF loading may start with an RDB data in case of
    rdb-preamble, in which case you'll only receive an AOF_START event.

* RedisModuleEvent_ClientChange

    Called when a client connects or disconnects.
    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleClientInfo
    structure, documented in RedisModule_GetClientInfoById().
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_CLIENT_CHANGE_CONNECTED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_CLIENT_CHANGE_DISCONNECTED`

* RedisModuleEvent_Shutdown

    The server is shutting down. No subevents are available.

* RedisModuleEvent_ReplicaChange

    This event is called when the instance (that can be both a
    master or a replica) get a new online replica, or lose a
    replica since it gets disconnected.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPLICA_CHANGE_ONLINE`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPLICA_CHANGE_OFFLINE`

    No additional information is available so far: future versions
    of Redis will have an API in order to enumerate the replicas
    connected and their state.

* RedisModuleEvent_CronLoop

    This event is called every time Redis calls the serverCron()
    function in order to do certain bookkeeping. Modules that are
    required to do operations from time to time may use this callback.
    Normally Redis calls this function 10 times per second, but
    this changes depending on the ""hz"" configuration.
    No sub events are available.

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleCronLoop
    structure with the following fields:

        int32_t hz;  // Approximate number of events per second.

* RedisModuleEvent_MasterLinkChange

    This is called for replicas in order to notify when the
    replication link becomes functional (up) with our master,
    or when it goes down. Note that the link is not considered
    up when we just connected to the master, but only if the
    replication is happening correctly.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_MASTER_LINK_UP`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_MASTER_LINK_DOWN`

* RedisModuleEvent_ModuleChange

    This event is called when a new module is loaded or one is unloaded.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_MODULE_LOADED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_MODULE_UNLOADED`

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleModuleChange
    structure with the following fields:

        const char* module_name;  // Name of module loaded or unloaded.
        int32_t module_version;  // Module version.

* RedisModuleEvent_LoadingProgress

    This event is called repeatedly called while an RDB or AOF file
    is being loaded.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_PROGRESS_RDB`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_LOADING_PROGRESS_AOF`

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleLoadingProgress
    structure with the following fields:

        int32_t hz;  // Approximate number of events per second.
        int32_t progress;  // Approximate progress between 0 and 1024,
                           // or -1 if unknown.

* RedisModuleEvent_SwapDB

    This event is called when a SWAPDB command has been successfully
    Executed.
    For this event call currently there is no subevents available.

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleSwapDbInfo
    structure with the following fields:

        int32_t dbnum_first;    // Swap Db first dbnum
        int32_t dbnum_second;   // Swap Db second dbnum

* RedisModuleEvent_ReplBackup

    WARNING: Replication Backup events are deprecated since Redis 7.0 and are never fired.
    See RedisModuleEvent_ReplAsyncLoad for understanding how Async Replication Loading events
    are now triggered when repl-diskless-load is set to swapdb.

    Called when repl-diskless-load config is set to swapdb,
    And redis needs to backup the current database for the
    possibility to be restored later. A module with global data and
    maybe with aux_load and aux_save callbacks may need to use this
    notification to backup / restore / discard its globals.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_BACKUP_CREATE`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_BACKUP_RESTORE`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_BACKUP_DISCARD`

* RedisModuleEvent_ReplAsyncLoad

    Called when repl-diskless-load config is set to swapdb and a replication with a master of same
    data set history (matching replication ID) occurs.
    In which case redis serves current data set while loading new database in memory from socket.
    Modules must have declared they support this mechanism in order to activate it, through
    REDISMODULE_OPTIONS_HANDLE_REPL_ASYNC_LOAD flag.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_ASYNC_LOAD_STARTED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_ASYNC_LOAD_ABORTED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_REPL_ASYNC_LOAD_COMPLETED`

* RedisModuleEvent_ForkChild

    Called when a fork child (AOFRW, RDBSAVE, module fork...) is born/dies
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_FORK_CHILD_BORN`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_FORK_CHILD_DIED`

* RedisModuleEvent_EventLoop

    Called on each event loop iteration, once just before the event loop goes
    to sleep or just after it wakes up.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_EVENTLOOP_BEFORE_SLEEP`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_EVENTLOOP_AFTER_SLEEP`

* RedisModule_Event_Config

    Called when a configuration event happens
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_CONFIG_CHANGE`

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleConfigChange
    structure with the following fields:

        const char **config_names; // An array of C string pointers containing the
                                   // name of each modified configuration item 
        uint32_t num_changes;      // The number of elements in the config_names array

* RedisModule_Event_Key

    Called when a key is removed from the keyspace. We can't modify any key in
    the event.
    The following sub events are available:

    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_KEY_DELETED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_KEY_EXPIRED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_KEY_EVICTED`
    * `REDISMODULE_SUBEVENT_KEY_OVERWRITTEN`

    The data pointer can be casted to a RedisModuleKeyInfo
    structure with the following fields:

        RedisModuleKey *key;    // Key name
